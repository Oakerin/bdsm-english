1. Pick up 3-4 tongue twisters. We recorded them here with my friend from Australia (you must enjoy it!) 
2. Learn them by heart. Record yourself and send me a link to the audio, better yet - a videorecording 
(we won't post it on social media without your permission, don't worry, the most important thing for me personally 
is that I see you are not cheating and you have learnt all 3 tongue twisters by heart).
3. Result: your homework = a link on audio or video, where you're pronouncing the tongue twisters.
