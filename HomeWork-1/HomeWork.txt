Homework:

1) Find two witnesses. Write down your declaration. Sign. Take a photo with them. No pets or kids under 18! The faces are not needed, but there must be three people at the picture (Skype or FaceTime are ok, too). If you want, you may post it online with a hashtag #бдсманглйиский - we have a special prize for those who post online in the end of the course.

2) If you haven’t done it yet, pass this test - write just your result here

3) Write in the form below a quick info about yourself. Who are you and what do you do? What do you expect from this course? What are you looking forward to this month?

Hello. My name is Stanislav. I live in Moscow, Russia. I graduated my Dmitry Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia two years ago. I'm a engineer in the chemical technology. Now I work in the cute office at the Dynamo metro station. I'm a web-programmer. So, I also need to use English to read documentation and speak with my foreign teammates. I know, that my English is not good, but easy to understand for another people. But this is not enough. I passed your test and get pre-intermediate level. It's because my grammar is on really low level and I want to improve it. I hope, that this course helps me to organize myself. Actually, I'm trying to speak with my foreign friends from Japan, Mexico, USA, Morocco, etc. But I need more. I expect from this course improving my grammar and something else English practice. Let's do it and get a lot of fun from our lessons. Best regards, Stanislav.
