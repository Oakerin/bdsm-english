Take a look at this sea, my friend. Do you see these birds? It's a gulls. I wish you knew that I really love it. Do you remeber how we play without Igar.. Oh.. Irgor.. Sorry, I again forget his name. Igor, of course! It was very funny and I really like that time. If only I could back us to past and feel it again.. At the forest there we walk, at the sleepy strets and loudy squares.. You know, I really think that Igar is a good man. Nevertheless, I hope you understand, that his horrible nature and his black teeth don't make you happy! You must fly like this gulls around the sea.. I know, that you dont want take my present. Still, I should give it to you. That modest yacht for you. Be happy with Irgor.
